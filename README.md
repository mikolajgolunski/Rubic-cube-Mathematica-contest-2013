# Rubic-cube-Mathematica-contest-2013
Contest for the best student's Mathematica project on WFAIS UJ in 2013. 1st place. Made in Wolfram Mathematica. Done together with my colleague Dariusz Kotas.

Notebook reads Rubic's cube faces from photos imported from files, from a computer's webcam or generates one randomly, than solves it creating a list of moves needed and visualization.

Solving algorythm is taken from a book "Magiczna kostka" by Wolfgang Hintze. It is highly inefficient but is easy to remember, using only a few basic sets of moves.

Repository includes also a small poster talking about the project and a PowerPoint presentation with some more details about the project.
